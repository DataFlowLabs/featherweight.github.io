This site aims to be a comprehensive guide to Featherweight. We’ll cover
topics such as integrating useful bits of Featherweight into your existing
applications, diving deeper into applications and application components
written using Featherweight Reference Designs, and general system design
strategy and tactics applicable even outside of using the Featherweight
libraries.

## Helpful Hints

Throughout this guide there are a number of small-but-handy pieces of
information that can make using Featherweight easier, more interesting,
and less hazardous. Here’s what to look out for.

{% include note.html type="protip" text="Nuggets of wisdom, clever tips, and idiomatic spiciness to take Featherweight to the next level." %}
{% include note.html type="info" text="Tidbits and minutiae to add clarity." %}
{% include note.html type="warning" text="Featherweight tries to not be opinionated, unintuitive, or weird, but sometimes it just is. Guidance from Warnings helps make sure your application doesn't 'splode." %}
{% include note.html type="contrib" text="The parts of Featherweight in a particularly mutable state should be used with caution in production, but they are also the pieces over which you can have the most influence." %}

If you come across anything along the way that we haven’t covered, or if you
know of a tip you think others would find handy, please [file an
issue]({{ site.repository }}/issues/new) and we’ll see about
including it in this guide.
